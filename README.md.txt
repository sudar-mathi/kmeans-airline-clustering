# ✈️ Airline Passenger Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

This project uses K-Means clustering to segment airlines based on passenger statistics. A Flask app is also provided to interact with the trained model.

## 📊 Business Objective
- **Goal**: Maximize operational efficiency and increase revenue
- **Technique**: K-Means Clustering (unsupervised)
- **Model Success**: Achieve Silhouette Score ≥ 0.7

## 🗂 Dataset
- Source: Airline Passenger Statistics CSV
- Size: Multiple years, airlines, terminals, months, and passenger counts

## ⚙️ Steps Followed (CRISP-ML(Q)):
1. Business & Data Understanding
2. Data Preprocessing (outliers, encoding, scaling)
3. Optimal K detection using Elbow and Silhouette
4. KMeans model training and saving
5. Deployment using Flask
